# Programming in C (4th ed) - by Stephan G Kochan
## 1 -  Introduction
- The operations a particular computer is able to perform is called an *instruction set*
- A program is a set of instructions that solve a particular problem
- An algorithm is the the steps that a program goes through
- Program dev goes like this:
    Problem > Algorithm > Progam > Solution/Solving
- A compliler converts a C program into a sequence of assembly instructions appropriate for a given system
- NOTE: This is often a nonlinear process involving recursive adjustments, optimizations, and pulling in of
    related files

### Compilation Steps
    source file > preprocess > syntax check > assembly > object code > linking > executable file
### Ececution Steps
    executable file > load into memory > sequential execution of instructions

- An alternative to compiled languages are interpreted languages (BASIC and JavaScript)
- Interpreted languages are executed and evaluated at runtime, allowing for easier debug at the cost of worse speed
