# baby-learns-c
This repo contains my initial efforts to learn the C programming language.

I'm putting it in a repo in part as a way to get familiar with git, and part as
a way to upload my notes in case anyone finds them useful.

#### This repo will include:
- Notes taken on learning resources
- Retyped example programs
- Programs that are answers to exercises

#### This repo will not include:
- Copies of resources (eg pdfs, downloaded html, docs)
- Other projects in C
